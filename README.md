# CodSoft-Java-Internship
This repository contains the source code and documentation of the tasks I completed during the CodSoft Java Internship program. The program is designed to provide me with valuable educational opportunities, focusing on learning, skill development, and gaining practical knowledge in Java programming.


The tasks are as follows:

- Task 1: Number Guessing Game
- Task 2: ATM Interface
- Task 3: Student Management System

I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow at CodSoft and look forward to tackling more challenging tasks in the future.

You can watch my task post videos on LinkedIn, where I demonstrate the code output and explain the logic behind it. Here are the links:
